To scale the gentle giants

To hike the steep inclines 

To glance upon a hidden place 

That once was left behind 

<br/>

To feel the breeze upon your skin

A dance so bold and light 

To wrap yourself in fire and wool 

A saviour through the night 

<br/>

To face the sun

Declare the moon

A beauty among the stars 

To feel the clouds

Engulf the earth 

Disappearing every scar

<br/>

To roam is to bare witness

To roam is to explore 

To roam is to make vivid

A world that one day will become no more
