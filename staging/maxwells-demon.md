It was a late autumn afternoon when John was sitting at his usual table in the cafe around the corner from his lab. It had been a while since he had visited, but not too long that the existing waitstaff had moved on to other opportunities. They had welcomed him at the door as they always did, asking him how his day was going and why it had been so long. John laughed it off, made up some lame excuse, and they gave him their warm smile. He had always appreciated the familial welcome, even if it was only for a few moments each day. It felt like the last remnants of community that the city had lost many years ago, gently rearing its head above the skyscrapers as if to say _I'm still here_.

Molly, a waitress at the cafe approached John's table and smiled.

"So, what are you thinking today?"

"A Cappuccino, please. And maybe some fried eggs on sourdough."

"Avocado on the side?"

John smiled, impressed that she remembered his usual order.

"Go on, then", he replied.

"Coming right up."

Molly collected the menu from Max's table and made her way back over to the counter. John turned his attention to the tablet and digital pencil resting in front of him. He turned the screen back on and began revising the notes that he had written minutes earlier. Seeing it all laid out in front of him, it became harder and harder to stay calm. Beads of sweat had already started forming around his temple, and his undershirt began to feel tight against his chest. He turned away and took a moment to appreciate the view out the window, looking down over the city. He closed his eyes briefly, slowed his breathing, and his heart rate began to drop.

_Calm_. _Stay calm_.

His phone buzzed against the table. The screen came on and a message appeared. Kim was down the street and would arrive in a few moments. John shut off the screen on his tablet and sat still for a moment, contemplating how he would begin the upcoming conversation.

Molly approached and gently placed the coffee cup in front of him. 

"You doing ok?"

"Oh, yes, fine. Just a lot going on, you know?"

"Well, whatever it is, take it easy. I'm sure it's not the end of the world."

John smiled meekly, and nodded. Molly turned away, and he looked beyond her to see Kim entering the front door of the cafe. He waved her over, and she weaved her way around to the table.

"John Maxwell. It's been a minute."

"It sure has. Thanks for meeting me here."

"I don't make it to this side of the city much, so it's win-win for me."

Molly approached again to deliver John his breakfast.

"I'm sorry, I didn't think to wait."

Kim saw the concern on John's face
