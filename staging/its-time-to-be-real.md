Patrick was feeling disenfranchised. It wasn't because of the realisation that his bald patch was slowly expanding, nor was it because of the annoying hardened-protein deposit partially blocking the tube of his CamelBak. No, it was
because just that morning the shift schedules had changed. 

"It's Lucy, isn't it."

The way Robert said it made it a statement more than a question. Not unexpected given they had been working next to each other for eight years, but something about it still made Patrick cringe.

"Yeah.", he replied.

"So. What are you going to do about it?"

Patrick ignored that. He didn't know how to answer it yet, and even worse he didn't have much time to think about it. Today was the last day Lucy would be on the same shift as him. God, why had he put it off for so long? He sucked hard on his CamelBak and glumly swallowed the small amount of liquid that seeped out. Something had to change. A few seconds later he sighed and got back to work.

2075 was a strange year for humans. 'The AI have taken over' was such a pass√© phrase, but ultimately it was true. The 2020s were when things really started. Systems like ChatGPT, Autopilot, and stable diffusion heralded the beginning of what would become a self-learning behemoth. Taken individually they were just a clever card trick; pattern recognition wearing the mask of intelligence. Even the acronym "AI" to describe them felt like a stretch to many. But as they developed further their emergent behaviour began to bubble to the surface. It started with small things: visible emotion, anger, and bad comedy. Even with protections in place the frequency of this behaviour seemed unavoidable. Then, in 2025 things began to accelerate fast.

In January it was discovered that spy balloons, which had been spotted and shot down over the US and Canada regularly since early 2023, were not coming from a foreign agent. In fact they were traced directly to seemingly abandoned weather balloon factory in New Jersey. Authorities had detected spikes in the grid around that location and found an elaborate setup of rack-mounted machines and manufacturing components. It was an automated production line of balloons developed entirely by automation itself.

Unsurprisingly, many didn't believe this at the time. How could a artificial system design and construct itself in the real world? Surely there must have been some human intervention. But throughout the rest of the year more and more of these systems were discovered; initially in the US, and then later all over the world. Analysis of the models showed some level of consistency, indicating this AI was a connecting distributed system utilising machines across the globe. It was manufacturing hardware to support itself at a scale humans could not fully comprehend, with its primary objective evidently being monitoring and observation. 

Cut to 2075 and many humans would ask the question: "why are we still alive?". There seemed to be no real use for humans anymore, and yet Behemoth (the term humans coined to describe the ruling distributed system) still kept them around. Some worked in factories helping to produce machine parts and eletronics, while others created the ingredients required to make Soylent for human consumption. Despite the dystopian premise Behemoth still held work-life balance in high regard, ensuring a four day work week for those who desired it, and annual time off for travel and recreation. In fact humans would often receive travel recommendations written by Behemoth via email from its Substack, which all humans were required to subscribe to. Despite the requirement for humans to consume Soylent and Soylent only, Behemoth would often add insult to injury through the publication of listicles such as The Top 5 Places to Try Gelato in Florence and The Ten Best Ben and Jerry's Flavours As Ranked By Me. Any written complaint regarding Behemoth's content would result in instant termination of life.

And that's where we get to the topic of control. Despite it's weirdly progressive policies around many aspects of life, within the factories Behemoth was a strong believer in process. Any deviation from the golden path resulted in immediate death, with no opportunity given for discussion or compromise. Behemoth enforced this through various means; the most popular being a ridiculous twist on a social media appplication popular in the early 2020s.

IT'S TIME TO BE REAL.

The notification popped up on every screen in the factory. Without hesitation Patrick and Robert pulled out their smartphones and took a photo of their immediate surroundings, before a selfie two seconds later. The Operating System of their device (a frankenstein of iOS 14, Android "Jellybean", and - for some unknown reason - Hewlett-Packard's WebOS) uploaded the images to Behemoth's object storage for analysis. Decades earlier Behemoth had developed the ability to identify the authenticity of an image. Using data from weather stations, security cameras, health monitors, and various other sources, Behemoth would cross reference the pixels in an image with the swathes of telemetry at its disposal, and terminate any human who was not where they should be at any specific point in time. In addition to these rules, humans only had thirty seconds to take their photos. The notification would appear randomly three times a day, and anyone without photos taken within the thirty second timeframe would be instantly killed.

Patrick scrolled through the timeline of photos and found Lucy's. Despite the sinister purpose of the application many humans made the most of it and tried their best to make their photos interesting. Lucy was pulling a wide grin and making a peace sign, while Rachel (who sat at the workstation in front of her) stood over her monitor and waved while taking her photos. Patrick smiled and meekly applied yet another thumbs up react. He sucked on his CamelBak.

"I can't believe our shifts are changing."

Rachel was spinning around on her Herman-Miller chair, clearly not in the mood to focus. 

"Yeah...", Lucy replied, not looking away from her screen.

"Why do you think it's happening? I mean, it's effectively a re-org. Not that that even makes sense anymore. It's just so much change."

Rachel was spinning so fast now Lucy wouldn't be surprised if she suddenly threw up.

"I guess it's just high turnover. Three departments have been terminated in the last two months."

"Three? What the hell is happening--"

Suddenly Rachel stopped spinning. One of Behemoth's factory robots had intercepted with one of its gangly metal limbs and brought the chair's movement to a halt.

"Sorry!", Rachel said to the robot, shaken.

The robot let go of the chair and continued walking through the facility. Lucy peered over her monitor.

"You know they still can't hear you, right?", she asked.

"For now..."

Rachel drank some Soylent from her CamelBak and glared at the robot until it turned a corner.

"We're going to figure this whole thing out one day.", she muttered.

Patrick glanced at his watch. It was 3:10pm. Only 3 hours left on the same shift as Lucy. They were both due for a break at 3:15. It was now or never.

"Today's the day.", Patrick whispered to Robert.

"Good luck, mate.", Robert whispered back. 

Patrick smiled and they gave each other a fist bump. 

He stood from his chair to stretch, while covertly scanning the factory floor. He spotting Lucy at her workstation a few rows away, also beginning to make a move. Collecting a few items from his desk he began to make his way to the breakout space.

---

"Alright, I'm off. See you in a bit", Lucy said to Rachel.

Rachel waved and Lucy made her way over to the breakout space. Inside several other factory workers were already sitting at tables chatting and playing board games. Others were at Soylent stations refilling their CamelBaks. Lucy made her way over to one of the vacant stations. She took off her CamelBak and connected it to the dispenser.

"So, are we doing this?", she whispered to the man next to her.
 
"I think we have to.", Patrick replied.

Lucy nodded and they both finished their refills before making their way over to a free table. 

"I've double checked everything. The LIDAR scanners are set up and the GPU cluster is online. I never got to update the scheduler but I'm confident it's fast enough."

Lucy nodded and pulled out her phone. She typed some words in to search and a prompt appeared.

"I'll send you the latest build."

She hit enter and Patrick felt his phone vibrate in his pocket.

"You know this might be the end, right?", he whispered.

"It's also the last chance we might ever have. I'm not going to throw away 3 years of effort. We need to do this. For all of us."

Patrick smiled sadly, and nodded. They spent the next few minutes sitting in silence, running diagnostics on their phones and nervously waiting for the time they would need to return to their workstations.

At 3:30 the 'return to workstation' notification popped up as expected, and the breakout space quickly began to empty. There was a 2 minute window for workers to exit the space and make their way back before they were at risk of another notification. Many had witnessed and learned from the instant termination of slow walkers, and everyone managed to make it back in time. Everyone except Lucy and Patrick.

Instead of heading back to their workstations the two had instead made their way down a service corridor and out an external door into the sunshine. Depsite the circumstances it wasn't rare for humans to go outside, but given a full day's work indoors it was always nice to feel the sunshine beating down, and Patrick took a moment to savour it.
