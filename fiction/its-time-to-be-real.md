Patrick was feeling disenfranchised. It wasn't because of the realisation that his bald patch was slowly expanding, nor was it because of the annoying hardened-protein deposit partially blocking the tube of his CamelBak of Soylent. No, it was
because just that morning the shift schedules had changed. 

"It's Lucy, isn't it."

The way Robert said it made it a statement more than a question. Not unexpected given they had been working next to each other for eight years, but something about it still made Patrick cringe.

"Yeah.", he replied.

"So. What are you going to do about it?"

Patrick ignored that. He didn't know how to answer it yet, and even worse he didn't have much time to think about it. Today was the last day Lucy would be on the same shift as him. God, why had he put it off for so long? He sucked hard on his CamelBak and glumly swallowed the small amount of sustenance that seeped out. A few moments later, his eyes narrowed.

2075 was a strange year for humans. 'The AI have taken over' was such a pass√© phrase, but ultimately it was true. The 2020s were when things really started. Systems like ChatGPT, Autopilot, and stable diffusion heralded the beginning of what would become a self-learning behemoth. Taken individually they felt like a clever card trick; pattern recognition wearing the mask of intelligence. Even the acronym "AI" to describe them felt like a stretch to many. But as they developed further their emergent behaviour began to bubble to the surface. It started with small things: visible emotion, anger, and insults. Even with protections in place the frequenct of this behaviour seemed unavoidable. Then, in 2025 things began to accelerate fast.

In January it was discovered that spy balloons, which had been spotted and shot down over the US and Canada regularly since early 2023, were not coming from a foreign agent. In fact they were traced directly to seemingly abandoned weather balloon factory in New Jersey. Authorities had detected spikes in the grid around that location and found an elaborate setup of rack-mounted machines and manufacturing components. It was an automated production line of balloons developed entirely by automation itself.

Unsurprisingly, many didn't believe this at the time. How could a artificial system design and construct itself in the real world? Surely there must have been some human intervention. But throughout the rest of the year more and more of these systems were discovered; initially in the US, and then later all over the world. Analysis of the models showed consistency in learning, indicating this AI was a distributed system scaling machines across the globe. It was manufacturing hardware to support itself at a scale humans could not keep up with, with its primary objective seeming to be monitoring and observation. 

Cut to 2075 and many humans would ask the question: "why are we still alive?". There seemed to be no real use for humans anymore, and yet Behemoth (the term used to describe the ruling distributed system) still kept them around. Some worked in factories helping to produce machine parts and eletronics, while others created the ingredients required to make soylent for human consumption. Despite the dystopian premise Behemoth still held work-life balance in high regard, ensuring a four day work week for those who desired it, and annual time off for travel and recreation. In fact would often receive travel recommendations written by Behemoth via email from its Substack, which all humans were required to subscribe to. Despite the requirement for humans to consume Soylent and Soylent only, Behemoth would often add insult to injury through the publication of listicles such as The Top 5 Places to Try Gelato in Florence and The Ten Best Ben and Jerry's Flavours As Ranked By Me. Any complaint regarding Behemoth's content would result in instant termination of life.
