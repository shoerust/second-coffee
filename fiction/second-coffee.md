“Hudson, screen 2 off.”

The light on Ray’s face adjusts slightly as the harsh glow of the news program on the screen in front of him disappears. The rain outside falls heavier. 

He sighs. A fire burns softly in the corner, warming the room with its dance of light and shadows. The walls, lined with black screens and books, begin to feel as though they’re moving. They close in on a room that was once welcoming and spacious, but is now conducive to the worst symptoms of claustrophobia.

Ray closes his eyes and leans back in his armchair, focusing on the sound of the water hitting the tiles outside. A few moments pass and his eyes open; a renewed sense of acceptance in his demeanour. With the aide of his walking stick he lifts himself from the chair and slowly makes his way to the kitchen.

“Hudson, coffee.”

The coffee machine powers to life and begins the brewing process. Ray leans against the bench and watches the clouds get ever darker through the window above the sink. A soft purr breaks his reverie. He turns to see Pixel walk across the countertop towards him.

“I’m sorry, old friend. I’m sorry about us”, he mutters softly, delicately brushing his fingers along the cat’s neck. Pixel purrs again, blinking in satisfaction and moving closer. Ray continues petting her while gazing back out at the storm.

The coffee machine beeps to signal completion and Ray removes the mug from holder.
“I guess we have to make the most of it.”

Pixel follows Ray back in to the sitting room where he takes a seat at his writing desk in the corner. The window above the desk shows the same view from the kitchen; a perfect storm over rolling hills and forest. Lightning flashes in the distance.

Pixel deftly manouvers up onto the desk and finds her usual place on a folded blanket in the rightmost corner. Another purr of satisfaction. Ray smiles and takes a sip.

He puts the mug down and opens the bottom draw of the desk. He removes a few candles and a box of matches, setting each around the desk and lighting them with a cupped hand. Pixel, seemingly used to this activity, is unperturbed by the flames.

Ray places the lighter back in the draw and takes another sip from his mug. As if on cue, the power to the house suddenly ceases and anything not illuminated by fire is plunged into darkness. Pixel raises her head in anticipation for a few moments. Sensing no immediate danger and Ray’s continued presence, she relaxes back to her original position. Ray, unsurprised by the power outage, leans further forward, elbows on table, mug in hand, illuminated only by candles and the fire at the other end of the room. Watching the storm become ever stronger, he takes another sip.

A soft glow appears on the horizon. Expanding and refracted by raindrops on the window, it looks like headlights of a car moving closer. Ray watches it closely as it expands to cover more area, gradually becoming warmer in colour. The storm rages on, hammering against the glass. He takes another sip, his mind drifting to the many eyes that would be watching what he is watching. The eyes that have watched it.

The glow becomes brighter now, a direct light spanning the horizon. The clouds reflect the light, becoming somehow angrier against the mottled sky. Ray subconsiously moves his hand over to pet Pixel. She purrs again, warm and comfortable. He drinks the last of the coffee, savouring it’s flavour while gazing at the ever expanding light outside; it’s intensity now increasing rapidly. He sighs and turns to Pixel, smiling sadly.

“Goodbye, old friend.”

The light breaches the final hill and encompasses the house.
